Goals I completed last week:
[ ] Ran linear regression models
[ ] Ran clustering models
Goals for this week:
[ ] Continue to narrow down some of my overarching research questions (focus in on what I really want to solve)
[ ] Continuing to work on my linear, logistic, and clustering models for my project
[ ] Start analyzing the data and tables to figure out what my data is producing to answer my research questions and figure out if I have any gaps in my data and analysis for the project
